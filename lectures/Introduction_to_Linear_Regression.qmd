# Introduction to Linear Regression

## A Linear Model

-   Linear regression is a common technique in the social sciences.
-   Distills complex relationships to a simple linear relationship.

$$y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i$$

-   **Intercept** ($\alpha$): The point at which the regression line crosses the $y$-axis, or the value of $y$ when $x=0$.

-   **Slope** ($\beta$): The change in $y$ for every unit change in $x$. Formally: $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \beta$

### Example

$$y_{\text{RepublicanCandidate}} = \alpha + \beta_1 x_{\text{PID}}$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Some Common Misconceptions

### Reverse Causality

$x$ may be caused by $y$ rather than the reverse.

### Confounding

$x$ may be related to $y$, but there is a common variable affecting both.

### Mediation

A relationship may be indirect through another variable.

### The Challenge

It is difficult to sort these out using a regression model with **observed cross-sectional data**.

In most applications, we observe the outcome of a process. It is often difficult to make claims about the process itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Observation versus Manipulation

### Experimental versus Observational

Is $x$ observed or under the control of the researcher?

-   If **observational**: We can examine whether a relationship exists, but that relationship does not imply causation.

### Correlation versus Regression

The two are intimately related, but we make several key assumptions in the regression equation.

-   **Dependent variable** (regressand): The outcome
-   **Explanatory variable** (regressor): The predictor
-   The explanatory variable is **fixed and exogenous**; the dependent variable is **random and endogenous** *(Gujarati and Porter, p. 21)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Randomization and Control

-   In some cases, $x$ can be manipulated through random assignment.
-   Assign units to a treatment or control condition.
-   **Gold standard**: Random assignment to treatment conditions.

### Theoretical Advantage

When units are randomly assigned to treatment: $$\text{cor}(x, \epsilon) = 0$$

This is because confounding variables are theoretically unrelated to treatment assignment.

This is a key assumption of the regression model that experiments naturally satisfy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Treatment Effects

Let $T_i$ represent assignment to a treatment condition:

$$y_i = \alpha + \beta T_i + \epsilon_i$$

Here, $\beta$ is the **treatment effect**, the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)**:

$$E(\beta) = E(\delta_i) = E(Y_{i,1} - Y_{i,0}) = E(Y_{i,1}) - E(Y_{i,0})$$

### Important Note

If the true model is $y_i = \alpha + \beta T_i + \omega x_i + \epsilon_i$ and $X$ and $T$ are correlated, then: $$\text{cor}(x, \epsilon) \neq 0$$

Random assignment to $T$ theoretically ensures $\text{cor}(x, \epsilon) = 0$ because confounders are equally distributed across treatment groups.

# Key Terms and Definitions

## Data Types

**Random/Stochastic Variables**

:   Variables that take on a set of values drawn from a probability distribution.

**Cross-Sectional Data**

:   Units observed once. Indexed with $i$: $x_i$

**Time Series Data**

:   A single unit observed multiple times. Indexed with $t$: $x_t$ - May *trend* (systematic change) or be *stationary* (randomly varying around a mean)

**Panel Data**

:   Multiple units observed over multiple time periods. Indexed with $i$ and $t$: $x_{it}$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Variable Types

| Type         | Zero Point | Distances   | Ordering | Examples                      |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Ratio**    | Natural    | Meaningful  | Natural  | Income, height, age           |
| **Interval** | None       | Meaningful  | Natural  | Temperature (°C), IQ          |
| **Ordinal**  | None       | Meaningless | Natural  | Education level, satisfaction |
| **Nominal**  | None       | Meaningless | None     | Religion, ethnicity, region   |

**Quantitative variables**: Ratio and Interval\
**Qualitative variables**: Ordinal and Nominal


# What is GitHub?

## GitHub Basics

**GitHub** is a web-based platform for:

- **Version Control**: Track changes to your code and documents
- **Collaboration**: Work with others on the same project
- **Project Management**: Organize tasks and track progress
- **Backup**: Store your work in the cloud
- **Portfolio**: Showcase your work to employers and collaborators

### Key Insight
GitHub makes your code **transparent**, **reproducible**, and **collaborative**.

---

## Why Use GitHub?

### For Your Research
- Version Control. It allows you to track every change you make. 
- Collaboration. It allows you to easily share code and collaborate on projects.
- Reproducibility. It helps ensure that your analyses can be reproduced by others.
- Reversion. It allows you to revert to previous versions of your code.

# Key Concepts

## Repository (Repo)

A **repository** is a folder that contains:
- Your code files
- Data files
- Documentation (README.md)
- Configuration files
- Complete history of changes
- Let's have a look at the structure of a repo

### Example Structure
```
my_analysis/
├── README.md
├── data/
│   ├── raw_data.csv
│   └── processed_data.csv
├── code/
│   ├── 01_load_data.R
│   ├── 02_analysis.R
│   └── 03_visualize.R
└── output/
    ├── figures/
    └── tables/
```

## Setup

- Create an account at [github.com](https://github.com)
- Log into your account
- Search for this repository, fork it to your account, and clone it to your computer
- And, create a sample repository to practice with.

## `RStudio`

- Generally you should work from the terminal to use Git commands.
- You can access the terminal from within RStudio: **Tools** → **Terminal** → **New Terminal**
- Alternatively, when using RStudio, you can use the **Git** tab to perform Git operations via a graphical interface, the `Git` tab.
